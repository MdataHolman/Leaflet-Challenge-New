# Leaflet-Challenge-New

**Module 15 Challenge (New Repo)**

This challenge shows a dashboard of Earthquake Visualization from USGS GeoJson Feed using Leaflet. 

**My Dashboard can be found here [Leftlet Challenge](http://127.0.0.1:5500/leaflet-part-1/index.html) **

The Earthquake visualization reflects the magnitude of the earthquake by its size and the depth of the earthquake by color. 
Earthquakes with higher magnitudes should appear larger, and earthquakes with greater depth should appear darker in color.
The visualization includes popups that provide additional information about the earthquake when its associated marker is clicked.

**Legend can be found on the bottom right**
